Started the Assisting blind people with micro controllers. I found two great websites to help me with this
https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/object-recognition-using-esp32-cam-and-edge-impulse 
https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/assistive-tech-for-blind

The link on top uses edge impuls to train an esp32
and the bottom one trains a new model and uses a different micro controller
I haven't quite decided on what version I will use for primary reference

After reading through the second part I have learned they failed. I liked the direction they were going with training your own data through YOLOV but It looks like I will be following the first project as my guideline
