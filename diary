Started the Assisting blind people with micro controllers. I found two great websites to help me with this
https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/object-recognition-using-esp32-cam-and-edge-impulse 
https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/assistive-tech-for-blind

The link on top uses edge impuls to train an esp32
and the bottom one trains a new model and uses a different micro controller
I haven't quite decided on what version I will use for primary reference

After reading through the second part I have learned they failed. I liked the direction they were going with training your own data through YOLOV but It looks like I will be following the first project as my guideline

So I bought all the pieces but I can't put it togetether cause I don't have the USB connection wire
But Now I can take photos for edge impulse and upload it so I will be doing that
So I have figured out that edge impulse uses photos of things to identify it so we are gonna use a kaggle data set and see
So I couldn't find any pedestrian data so I will be taking my own photos
